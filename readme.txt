== Description ==

**EasyAzon** is the quickest way to create Amazon affiliate links from within your WordPress post editor.

[Upgrade to EasyAzon Pro to unlock more affiliate link options and link types](http://easyazon.com/why-pro/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easyazonwporgtop "Upgrade to EasyAzon Pro")

= EasyAzon Features =

EasyAzon set up is simple and we support every location that has an Amazon Associates affiliate program including:

* United States
* Canada
* China
* France
* Germany
* India

You can create text affiliate links that can be optionally toggled to open in new windows and/or have the nofollow attribute applied. This can be controlled site wide through the plugin setting page defaults or individually controlled on a per link basis.

= EasyAzon Pro Additional Affiliate Link Types =

In addition to text affiliate links you can also create:

1. Image affiliate links(insert an image of a product from Amazon and turn that image into a clickable affiliate link)
1. Product information blocks (displays product title, image thumbnail, price info and a buy button in a styled block)
1. Call to actions (insert Amazon.com buy buttons)

= EasyAzon Pro Additional Affiliate Link Options =

In addition to toggling links to open in new windows or applying the nofollow attribute you can also enable:

1. Automated affiliate link cloaking
1. Product pop ups (display product info via a pop up box on mouse hover)
1. Add to cart functionality (increases the cookie length which gives you more time to earn a commission if the visitor adds the item to their shopping cart)
1. Automatic link localization (earn commissions from previously wasted global traffic by automatically converting affiliate links to match the location your website is being visited from: e.g. UK visitors see Amazon.co.uk links)
1. Support for multiple affiliate tracking ID's (track which links convert best)

If you have any foreign traffic, you'll most likely see an immediate bump in your Amazon commissions upon installing EasyAzon Pro.
